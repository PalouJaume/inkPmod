## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this project, Iâ€™m sharing a solution to extend the functionality of the Pynq Z2 board by adding support for an E-Ink display from Adafruit. Since none of the existing Pmod modules met my needs, I decided to design a custom one using KiCad.

To make the integration work smoothly, I also created a custom IP block to handle communication between the Pynq board and the E-Ink display. On top of that, I developed a basic API that allows the display to be controlled in both bare-metal applications and a lightweight Linux distribution.
