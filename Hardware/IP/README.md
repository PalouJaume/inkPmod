# üß≠ Digital Circuit Design

Before jumping into implementation, it's essential to address a few design questions that guide our development choices. These questions will help shape the architecture of the digital circuit and ensure it meets performance and usability expectations.

## üß† How will we measure the frequency of the sinusoidal signal from the XADC?

The XADC (Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter) gives us a digitized version of the input analog signal. However, to determine the frequency, we must process that data further.

A straightforward and effective method is to use a [frequency counter](https://andybrown.me.uk/2016/02/21/nanocounter/). The idea is to:

- Convert the analog sinusoid to a square wave (e.g., by thresholding).
- Count the number of cycles of the square wave in a given time frame.
- Compare this with a known clock signal to compute frequency.

This approach is hardware-friendly and works well in real-time digital systems.

## üî¢ How do we display binary numbers on 7-segment displays?

XADC outputs binary values that aren't human-readable in their raw form. To make these values suitable for display, we‚Äôll convert them into [Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal).

BCD makes it easier to display numbers on standard 7-segment displays, which are designed for decimal digits.

### Conversion Method

To perform this conversion in hardware, we use the [Double Dabble algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dabble). It's a simple and effective way to convert binary values into BCD, with low resource usage ‚Äî perfect for FPGA implementation.

The output will then drive four 7-segment displays, allowing easy real-time monitoring.

## ‚è±Ô∏è What sampling rate do we need?

We are working with a signal approximately **10 kHz** in frequency. To capture the waveform accurately:

- **Minimum sampling rate:** 20 kHz (according to the **Nyquist Theorem**).
- In practice, a higher rate (e.g., 50‚Äì100 kHz) might be used to improve accuracy and reliability.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Nyquist Theorem**  
> If a function contains no frequencies higher than BW Hz, it is completely determined by samples taken every 1/(2BW) seconds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è At what frequency will the digital circuit operate?

The operating frequency of the FPGA logic will depend on:

- The system clock (often 100 MHz or similar).
- Timing constraints of each processing block.
- Synchronization needs with the XADC.

We aim to design a system that maintains performance without violating setup and hold times. Clock domain crossing and timing analysis will play an essential role here.

## üì° How do we communicate with the XADC?

Communication with the XADC is done via the **Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP)**. This port allows us to:

- Read samples from the analog input channels.
- Configure parameters such as sampling rate and averaging.
- Monitor internal signals like temperature or supply voltage if needed.

## üöß What's next?

The next steps in this project include:

1. **Implementing the frequency counter** in VHDL.
2. **Designing the binary-to-BCD converter** using Double Dabble and VHDL.
3. **Driving the 7-segment display** to visualize the signal frequency.
4. **Integrating with the XADC** using the DRP.
